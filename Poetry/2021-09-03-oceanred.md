## OCEAN RED
A death prison,
Many prisons of death.
   In the ocean I die,
a vending of death.

Oceans are red,
   with some blue.

In the ocean I am resting,
I find oceans so arresting.
Perhaps Ill dine with all the fishes,
Perhaps Ill dine with the sharks.

As I rest and sleep I wait,
   and dine with all the fish.
