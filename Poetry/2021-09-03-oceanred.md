## OCEAN RED
A death prison,<br />
Many prisons of death.<br />
   In the ocean I die,<br />
a vending of death.<br />

Oceans are red,<br />
   with some blue.<br />

In the ocean I am resting,<br />
I find oceans so arresting.<br />
Perhaps Ill dine with all the fishes,<br />
Perhaps Ill dine with the sharks.<br />

As I rest and sleep I wait,<br />
   and dine with all the fish.
